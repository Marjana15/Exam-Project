#In this project, we developed an exam system prototype that would be very beneficial in the future for many sorts of educational institutions. Here, we have developed a Java GUI for ExamSystemGui that has two buttons. One button will say "Teacher," and the other button will say "Student." When the teacher button is hit, a password prompt will appear. If entered correctly, the teacher can then construct questions that are saved in question files memory as question.txt. The password in this case will be "admin." The student can then read the questions from questions.txt and submit them which will be saved in a directory called answers and file name will be saved in his "ID".txt for example 213-134-001.txt
